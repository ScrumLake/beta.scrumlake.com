    Our commitment is that we will never sell your data or hold it for longer than we need to. If you would like a copy
    of all of the data we hold related to you, please make a written request to us and we will respond.
    <br />If you’d like more information, please keep reading!

    <br/><h2>1. How we process your data</h2>
    <br />1.1. When you register for a course or workshop, we ask for your email address, name, address, payment
    information
    and similar data. We use this to keep you informed with information about the course and to send you an invoice.
    Before and after the course, we may send you a few emails with additional materials.
    <br />1.2. When you sign up to receive our blogs or newsletter, we will ask for your email address so that we can
    send you these blogs and newsletters. At any time you can unsubscribe from these by emailing us. We will then remove
    your details from our system.
    <br />1.3. If you email us, or send us messages through other platforms, we may keep a history of these messages for
    the purpose of keeping track of conversations. All official communication will come from the ‘@scrumlake.com’ domain
    email addresses or our Eventbrite email address.
    <br />1.4. We don’t sell your personal data or trade it with others for commercial purposes;
    <br />1.5. We make no assurances of how any third-party (e.g. Zoom, Eventbrite, Miro) store and use your data.
    <br/><h2>2. How we store your data</h2>
    <br />2.1. Data stored in third-party platforms (e.g. Zoom, EventBrite, Miro) is stored
    per that platform’s security protocols;
    <br />2.2. If we determine that your personal data has been compromised by unauthorised third-parties, we will
    inform the authorities and comply with GDPR legislation.
    <br/><h2>3. Changes</h2>
    We reserve the right to change this privacy policy as circumstances change, our services are updated or when it is
    required to do so by law.
