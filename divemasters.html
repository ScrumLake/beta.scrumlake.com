    <p>
        Scrum Lake is developed and co-facilitated by John Albrecht and Ryan Brook. They are both experienced Scrum
        Masters who love working with teams and growing a culture of continuous improvement. We help our workshop
        participants navigate through Scrum Lake by facilitating connection and deeper discussion. We are facilitators
        and active participants on the journey into Scrum Lake. Our favourite part of Scrum Lake is meeting with other
        experienced practitioners and sharing ideas.

            <p>Ryan spends his time working with teams and organisations to change
                their mindset from 'delivery at whatever cost' to 'value at whatever cost'. Whilst he refers to himself
                as a Scrum Master, he isn't wedded to one particular framework. He uses
                creativity and a positive attitude to affect change and encourages people to find what
                works for them. Improving organisational culture is
                the backbone of Ryan's practice. Without it, he believes teams are not able to reap the
                benefits of an empirical framework.</p>
