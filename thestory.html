    <p>
        Scrum Lake started in August 2020 when John and Ryan first met to discuss advanced Scrum assessments. They
        concluded that that in order to deepen knowledge, they would first need to
        deepen their experience. To achieve this, they spoke about the content that was needed, but more
        importantly, spoke about how this content is learned, embedded and embodied.

        Ryan's spoke about his experience as an ex-teacher and how 'stick learning' could provide concepts with with a
        'hook' to make re-call more fluid. When they combined this with John's
        experiences of clean language, use of metaphor and stories and the work he has done over the years with
        teams and organisations, they started to create their vision. Whilst there are many options to
        achieve effective recall, a common one is through story-telling because deep down, brains love to play. They
        crave fun,
        imagination and continued learning - metaphors and analogies are one way to achieve this. Over several weeks
        they worked together exploring personal metaphors for Scrum and learning, co-creating a unique way to
        explore Scrum.
    </p>
    <p>
        In early September 2020, after personally receiving value from metaphor based exploration and discussion, they
        both felt it was time to test a hypothesis
        out on the
        community. To do this, they mapped out their metaphors' boundaries and created an interactive canvas from which
        to share them. This
        was
        the birth of Scrum Lake. Unconsciously the structure and shape of the lake seemed to fall into place, it formed
        a familiar 3, 5, 3 pattern, offering interwoven routes, connections and paths to tell stories about Scrum. The
        community was overwhelmingly positive. By continually running workshops and
        incrementally developing the product, Scrum Lake has grown organically through input from its stakeholders. Ryan
        and John
        believe it shows value due to offering practitioners the chance to explore questions and scenarios that are
        personal to them to fellow Scrum Masters.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Scrum Lake Metaphors and Analogies.
        <span class="text-muted"> Do they work for you?

    </h2>
    <p>
        In the workshops, we use a range of analogies and metaphors to aid discussions. Metaphors are a divining rod for
        the
        brain as they enable us embody the environment and help us to attach meanings
        to things. Whilst these are 'our' metaphors (and we hope you find them useful),
        we encourage you to come up with your own during our workshops to support your understanding.

    <h2>Scrum Lake</h2>
    <p>Scrum - Scrum is like a lake. It is deep and filled with unknowns due to its complexity. It has a turbulent
        surface where things aren't transparent, but the deeper you go, the more evidence you can gather to adapt the
        exploration. It is a lake based on empiricism.
    </p>

    <p>Five Values - The values are the bedrock of the lake. They support the boundaries. If the bedrock cracks, the
        water can leak away, taking focus away from exploration and onto fixing the boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>Three Pillars - The pillars support the whole lake. Without all three, the ability to explore and learn is
        impeded because the lake isn't supported. Any value produced from the lake is questionable.
    </p>

    <h2>The Events</h2>
    <p>Sprint - The Sprint is a voyage. It is timebound by the amount of supplies you take aboard your ship. All
        events and activities take place on the ship. It is a container for all things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sprint Planning - The Sprint Planning occurs whilst your ship is in port. You are at a 'known' location. You
        have gathered evidence from your previous voyages and use it to make a plan of where to explore next. You've
        gathered your supplies and you raise the sails to set off.
    </p>
    <p>Daily Scrum - The Daily Scrum is the helm of the ship. Based on your recent progress, you need to adapt your
        course to ensure you remain on track to find your treasure. Sometimes you may not need to change your course,
        but
        you
        ensure you at least inspect the progress you've made.
    </p>
    <p>Sprint Review - The Sprint Review occurs when you have found your treasure. You have travelled back to port
        and lowered your sails. You show your treasure to your stakeholders (the King/villagers), inspect it, and decide
        where
        you should explore next.
    </p>
    <p>Sprint Retrospective - The Sprint Retrospective is where you have dropped your anchor and the explorers are
        discussing their voyage. They discuss how things went and they do this to make their issues transparent so that
        they
        can
        make improvements for next time.
    </p>

    <h2>The Scrum Team</h2>

    <p>People - The Scrum Team consists of explorers who are on the voyage. There are different accountabilities for
        each, but they are all equal in supporting the voyage. They explore together.
    </p>
    <p>Impediments - The impediments are sharks in the lake. If they aren't avoided or removed from the lake, they
        will cause problems for the voyage. They make it so that you are less likely to obtain your treasure.
    </p>
    <p>Technical Debt - Technical debt is like an octopus. It wraps its tentacles around the process, progress and
        outcomes and unless regularly attended to, can become ingrained and hard to remove.
    </p>
    <h2>The Artefacts and Commitments</h2>

    <p>Product Backlog - You have built up a scroll of everything you want to achieve on your voyages. You may not
        need to do all of them, but it's a possible list that your explorers think they will need to do to achieve their
        goal.
    </p>
    <p>Product Goal - Your scroll has a title. It is a long term objective that they want to achieve. The title at
        the top of our scroll says: 'To own all the treasure in the lake so that we are the richest
        explorers of all time.' All explorers commit to this goal.
    </p>
    <p>Sprint Backlog - You know where you want to explore for your treasure, but you need a map! The treasure map
        describes the general area of where to explore and makes a best effort to plot your voyage, but everyone agrees
        that it can be changed as you progress.
    </p>
    <p>Sprint Goal - Every treasure map need an 'X' marks the spot. It is a fixed position, but how you get there is
        not fully known until you have made your voyage. Everyone agrees that it's achievable and valuable to get there.
    </p>
    <p>Increment - The treasure chest! It contains lots of individual pieces of treasure but together, they hold much
        more value.
    </p>
    <p>Definition of Done - You've found the treasure, but how do you guarantee it hasn't been tampered with? You use
        a padlock! When you deliver the treasure to the King/villagers, you can prove its quality by explaining what the
        padlock means and that they can trust the quality of it.
