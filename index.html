                Our Scrum Lake workshops are a safe and structured environment for Scrum enthusiasts to discuss stories
                and work together to learn more effective techniques to deliver positive change. They will provide you
                with the opportunity to explore a much deeper understanding of Scrum, working with other Scrum Masters
                to co-create, facilitated by two experienced Scrum Masters.
                No matter what your current 'level' of Scrum is, you are very welcome to join us and dive
                into our Lake to share, collaborate and grow.

                You will find our workshops to be a very interactive experience. The regular breakouts and story
                sharing, all bounded by supportive metaphors, help ensure that varied opinions, come to the surface and
                are explored together.

                of attendees and stories from around the world. You and your fellow divers will explore together. Do you
                want to dive deep into the Theory? Stay shallow and share stories? Whatever you want, we will explore
                further together.
